# GENESIS-SOVEREIGN: Autonomous Software Creation Engine

An autonomous AI swarm that discovers, creates, and evolves software projects by sensing global developer signals and achieving multi-agent consensus.

## Overview

GENESIS-SOVEREIGN is a self-directed AI system that:
- **Senses** global developer activity across GitHub, HackerNews, StackOverflow, and Reddit
- **Thinks** through multi-agent consensus (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon agents)
- **Creates** complete software projects autonomously
- **Evolves** by learning from its creations and community feedback

## Architecture

### üß† Brain (Multi-Agent Orchestration)
- **Alpha (Architect)**: Identifies opportunities and designs solutions
- **Beta (Validator)**: Ensures quality and feasibility
- **Gamma (Creator)**: Generates code and documentation
- **Delta (Memory)**: Maintains context and learning
- **Epsilon (Evolution)**: Drives continuous improvement

### üëÅÔ∏è Senses (Signal Processing)
- Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources
- Semantic embedding via NVIDIA NIM
- Pattern recognition and trend analysis

### üñêÔ∏è Hands (Creation Interface)
- Code generation and project scaffolding
- GitHub repository management
- Automated testing and deployment

### üåü Consciousness (Evolution Engine)
- Self-improvement mechanisms
- Memory consolidation
- SCRI (Swarm Collaborative Reasoning Interface) protocol

## Quick Start

### Local Development (Ollama)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up local environment
python local-dev/ollama-setup.py

# Run test swarm
python local-dev/test-swarm.py
```

### Cloud Deployment (AWS)
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure/aws/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply

# Deploy to EKS
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/
```
